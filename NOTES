# Notes about center-aligned texts

Some texts are horizontally center-aligned (particulary numerals). Often, due
to the nature of the font we're using, if you edit the mentioned text, you'll
find that they won't be center-aligned with respect to the frame.

To workaround:

- Create rectangle which encompasses the questioned text. The dimensions of the
  rectangle are provided by guidelines.
- Select it, then the text.
- Click "Object -> Align and Distribute"
- Set "Relative to:" to "First selected"
- Choose "Center on vertical axis" and "Center on horizontal axis"

# Notes about end markers
[from commit 59cab1e83a4077f8013df5adf8557180d735227d and
2816f9f5d3981927c634b50d2e2bda99729fb6d7]

Some signs are "start of-end" of signs pair (such as F4A-F4B). The "end
of" signs add straight line marker (often red) to their "start of"
counterpart.

To create the marker:

- Create the object which will be marked (the markee)
- (Optional) Duplicate the markee so that you can restore it later.
- Create the rectangular marker, which its width is greater than the
markee, and its height as you specified. Give the marker red fill
without stroke.
- Center-align the marker relative to the markee.
- Rotate the marker so that it touch both sides of the corner of the
markee, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- Select both the marker and the markee, then `Path -> Intersection`.
The result should be the final marker.
- Either recreate the exacly same markee, or restore the duplicate
markee created earlier to the same place as the original one.

The caveat of this method is when the markee has inner stroke created
in following section. When `Path -> Intersection` is applied to the
markee with inner stroke and the marker, the inner stroke will also be
intersected. This means that when the markee have been resized, the
marker have to be created again from scratch. However, this method is
called 'naive method' because it just accomplished a particular task.
 
# Notes about inner strokes
[from commit c9bfe32c0d0308eaaa84000d464ed3aaa036cdcf and
974906948c8a389119f566e07d68dbcfb0fe4c0a]

SVG specification doesn't allow inner strokes, so to create them in
Inkscape:
- Select an object you wish to create the stroke
- `Path -> Linked Offset`
- Change the linked offset path to no fill with desired stroke width,
then adjust the offset distance (gap from edge of the parent object)
If desired exact value of offset distance is required, fire up XML Editor
`Shift-Ctrl-X`. Make sure that the offset path is selected. Change the
value of `inkscape:radius` to negative of (desired offset distance plus
half of the stroke width). For example, to set offset distance to 2mm
if the stroke width is 3mm, set `inkscape:radius` to -(2 + 1/2 * 3)
= -3.5.
- Select the original object again, then create another linked offset
path.
- Move the Z index of the original object below two linked offfsets
created above.
- Select two linked offsetts of the object, then `Object -> Clip -> Set`

# Notes about creating frames with line separators
[from commit 0cad89caf02dd98443eb15802d0dc826a41be1ea with modifications]

To create frame with separators by dynamic offsetting:
- Draw frame with specified size and stroke.
- Draw one or more horizontal or vertical line separator. Make sure that
each separator run from one side of frame to the opposite side and the
stroke width and color is the same as the frame. You may need to enable
`Snap to Paths` and `Snap to Path Intersections`. If the frame have stroke,
the start and end point of line is snapped to the stroke.
- Select both frame and its separators, then `Path -> Dynamic Offset`.

To manipulate the frame (such as resizing or moving), the frame as well
as its separators need to be selected first.
    
The advantages over combining methods is that when resizing the frame,
the stroke is preserved (as long as scaling stroke and corner radius are
disabled).

# Notes about creating backgrounded texts which is edge-aligned
[from commit 9e9cdd1a09b2fd2a76b865e01000f1b66fdbd113]

To create text with background, while align the text edge the same as
other texts:
- Create the text object. Make sure that it edges are aligned the same
as several other text objects, that is make sure that x-coordinate of
the text and other texts are same.
- Draw background rectangle which the dimension are bigger than bounding
box size of the corresponding text. Set the rectangle color different
than the text.
- Select the text and the rectangle (not vice versa), then use `Align
and Distribute` to center-align the rectangle relative to the text.
- Lower the rectangle lower than text but above the frame. The text will
appear.
