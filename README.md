## FAQS
- **What's this?**

This is Indonesian road signs repo.

- **Why does it matter?**

Every countries/states have their own road signs. Most of them have 
well-documented *standard road signs*. Indonesia have them, too.
We choose to create this repo for sharing to every parties who wishes to 
modify or remaster them.

- **Why did you choose to create them (from scratch)?**

There are road signs compilation from 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Indonesia), however
it lacks of SVG version of them. So, we decided to recreate them based on the
regulation document.

- **Why are the sign collections mashup of signs?**
Up until 1970, we *closely* follows Dutch road sign rules (for we are their
former colony). *Remember History of Indonesia?*
Currently our road signs are based on:
  - MUTCD (USA) [for warning signs]
  - Vienna Convention (Europe) [for prohibitory and mandatory signs]
  - New Zealand and Japanese design
  - Custom-made [for signs in freeways]
