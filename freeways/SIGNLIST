# list of signs at freeways/motorways/expressways
# most of them are customary, so whether possible we also give their specs
# (in form of guidelines)

F4A -> start of freeway (awal jalan tol)
F4B -> end of freeway (akhir jalan tol)
F4C -> start of freeway name (awal nama jalan tol)
F4D -> end of freeway name (akhir nama jalan tol)

# note that F10C sign is similar to D10 series 
# our freeways are unnumbered in reality, though
F10C -> freeway route number (nomor rute jalan tol)
F10C-a -> three-digit version of F4C

F5A -> location marker (penunjuk kilometer)
F5B -> location marker [with meters]

# informational signs
