# Notes about center-aligned texts

Some texts are horizontally center-aligned (particulary numerals). Often, due
to the nature of the font we're using, if you edit the mentioned text, you'll
find that they won't be center-aligned with respect to the frame.

To workaround:

- Create rectangle which encompasses the questioned text. The dimensions of the
  rectangle are provided by guidelines.
- Select it, then the text.
- Click "Object -> Align and Distribute"
- Set "Relative to:" to "First selected"
- Choose "Center on vertical axis" and "Center on horizontal axis"

# Notes about end markers
[from commit 59cab1e83a4077f8013df5adf8557180d735227d and
2816f9f5d3981927c634b50d2e2bda99729fb6d7]

Some signs are "start of-end" of signs pair (such as F4A-F4B). The "end
of" signs add straight line marker (often red) to their "start of"
counterpart.

To create the marker:

- Create the object which will be marked (the markee)
- (Optional) Duplicate the markee so that you can restore it later.
- Create the rectangular marker, which its width is greater than the
markee, and its height as you specified. Give the marker red fill
without stroke.
- Center-align the marker relative to the markee.
- Rotate the marker so that it touch both sides of the corner of the
markee, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- Select both the marker and the markee, then `Path -> Intersection`.
The result should be the final marker.
- Either recreate the exacly same markee, or restore the duplicate
markee created earlier to the same place as the original one.

The caveat of this method is when the markee has inner stroke created
in following section. When `Path -> Intersection` is applied to the
markee with inner stroke and the marker, the inner stroke will also be
intersected. This means that when the markee have been resized, the
marker have to be created again from scratch. However, this method is
called 'naive method' because it just accomplished a particular task.
 
# Notes about inner strokes
[from commit c9bfe32c0d0308eaaa84000d464ed3aaa036cdcf and
974906948c8a389119f566e07d68dbcfb0fe4c0a]

SVG specification doesn't allow inner strokes, so to create them in
Inkscape:
- Select an object you wish to create the stroke
- `Path -> Linked Offset`
- Change the linked offset path to no fill with desired stroke width,
then adjust the offset distance (gap from edge of the parent object)
If desired exact value of offset distance is required, fire up XML Editor
`Shift-Ctrl-X`. Make sure that the offset path is selected. Change the
value of `inkscape:radius` to negative of desired offset distance plus
half of the stroke width.
- Select the original object again, then create another linked offset
path.
- Move the Z index of the original object below two linked offfsets
created above.
- Select two linked offsetts of the object, then `Object -> Clip -> Set`
