# Notes about center-aligned texts

Some texts are horizontally center-aligned (particulary numerals). Often, due
to the nature of the font we're using, if you edit the mentioned text, you'll
find that they won't be center-aligned with respect to the frame.

To workaround:

- Create rectangle which encompasses the questioned text. The dimensions of the
  rectangle are provided by guidelines.
- Select it, then the text.
- Click "Object -> Align and Distribute"
- Set "Relative to:" to "First selected"
- Choose "Center on vertical axis" and "Center on horizontal axis"

# Notes about end markers
[from commit 59cab1e83a4077f8013df5adf8557180d735227d]

Some signs are "start of-end" of signs pair (such as F4A-F4B). The "end
of" signs add straight line marker (often red) to their "start of"
counterpart.

To create the marker:

- Create the object which will be marked (the markee)
- (Optional) Duplicate the markee so that you can restore it later.
- Create the rectangular marker, which its width is greater than the
markee, and its height as you specified. Give the marker red fill
without stroke.
- Center-align the marker relative to the markee.
- Rotate the marker so that it touch both sides of the corner of the
markee, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
- Select both the marker and the markee, then `Path -> Intersection`.
The result should be the final marker.
- Either recreate the exacly same markee, or restore the duplicate
markee created earlier to the same place as the original one.
