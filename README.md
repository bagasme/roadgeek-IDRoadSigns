## FAQS
- **What's this?**

This is Indonesian road signs repo.
As you may know, every countries/states have their own road signs. 
Most of them have well-documented *standard road signs*. Indonesia have 
them, too. We choose to create this repo for sharing to every parties 
who wishes to modify or remaster them.

- **Why did you choose to create them (from scratch)?**

There are road signs compilation from 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_signs_in_Indonesia), however
it lacks of SVG version of them. So, we decided to recreate them based on the
regulation document.

- **Why are the sign collections mashup of signs?**
Up until 1970, we *closely* follows Dutch road sign rules (for we are their
former colony).
Currently our road signs are based on:
  - MUTCD (USA) [for warning signs]
  - Vienna Convention (Europe) [for prohibitory and mandatory signs]
  - New Zealand and Japanese design
  - Custom-made [for signs in freeways]

- **Which font used in these road signs?**

In signs based on the regulation, we used Clearview Highway font. 

For signs in freeways, FHWA Series fonts are used instead.

However, there is an exception: Limiting prohibitory signs (particulary speed 
and tonage [weight] limit) uses Arial).

- **Where can I get those fonts?**

There is 
[Roadgeek 2005 Fonts](https://www.fontspace.com/michael-d-adams/roadgeek-2005) 
which contain Clearview Highway fonts (as Series 1B to 6W) and FHWA Series 
fonts (as Series B to F). The Roadgeek fonts are used through the repo.

For Arial, the `ttf-mscorefonts-installer` or similar (depending on your 
distro) can be installed. Windows users should have Arial font installed.
