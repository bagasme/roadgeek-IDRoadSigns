# Notes about center-aligned texts

Some texts are horizontally center-aligned (particulary numerals). Often, due
to the nature of the font we're using, if you edit the mentioned text, you'll
find that they won't be center-aligned with respect to the frame.

To workaround:

- Create rectangle which encompasses the questioned text. The dimensions of the
  rectangle are provided by guidelines.
- Select it, then the text.
- Click "Object -> Align and Distribute"
- Set "Relative to:" to "First selected"
- Choose "Center on vertical axis" and "Center on horizontal axis"
